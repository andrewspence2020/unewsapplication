Objective:
My objective with this project was to make a application that I could use to navigate to different sites with easy access from the touch of a button.
I also wanted to be able to share and make a call from the app itself and go to Google maps all without leaving the app. I have used this project for personal use.

What I enjoyed most about making this project:  
What I enjoyed most about making this project was the fact that I was making a project for my favourite device. I also enjoyed the fact that android studio is visual friendly, so you get a preview  screen that shows what I'm building in real time.
I loved that I was able to learn Kotlin and  was able to utilize my skills in this project.

What I didn’t enjoy about this project:
The updates for the android studio gradle.I would update my projects gradle, then my project wouldn’t work for some reason so I had to debug the problems. But all fixed now.
I really wanted a fly out menu but couldn’t implement it.(Time Crunch)
